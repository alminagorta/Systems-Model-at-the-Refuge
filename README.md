# SWAMPS: [S]ystems model in [W]etlands to [A]llocate water and [M]anage [P]lant [S]pread

We developed a system model to quantify the hydro-ecological performance of diked wetlands and embed this performance into an optimization model to recommend water allocation and invasive vegetation control in wetlands. First, we measure the hydro-ecological performance for wetlands using the habitat suitability approach. Second, we subject model recommendations for water allocations and invasive plant management in wetlands to constraints like water availability, spatial connectivity of wetland units, hydraulic infrastructure capacities, plus financial and time resources available to manage invasive vegetation and water. Third, we applied the model at the [Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge], which is the largest wetland complex on the Great Salt Lake, Utah.
The approach demonstrates a framework to develop and apply hydro-ecological performance metrics for wetlands, embed those metrics into an optimization model, and recommend management strategies to improve wetland performance.

## Input and Output of the Model
The model uses a variety of input data to describe the hydrological, ecological, and management components. Model outputs comprise reports, time series, and maps that show water allocations and vegetation control actions among wetland units and how these actions affect the performance in each wetland unit and over time. The table below describes the main inputs and outputs of the model.

The optimization model was programmed using the General Algebraic Modeling System [GAMS] software. We used Microsoft [Excel] to storage the input data and [Matlab] to post-process and graphically display results.

## How to use the model:

Steps to Get Started:

1. Install the General Algebraic Modeling System ([GAMS]) version 24.1.3 or more recent.
  1. You can Download from www.gams.com.
2. Download the files contained on the [SystemModel] folder from the GitHub repository. Make sure to save the Input-xls file and the [GAMS code] on the same folder.
3. Run the [GAMS code]

[Excel]: https://products.office.com/en-us/excel
[Matlab]: http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/?refresh=true

### Alternative Scenarios:
The model can perform different scenarios such as:
* **Changes in invasive vegetation response**: Model allows estimating the natural expansions of invasive vegetation cover over time. To modify the invasive vegetation response:
  * Open the Excel file from the [SystemModel] folder and input the percentage of invasive vegetation response into the _vegRes_ sheet.Save the Excel input file and then run the [GAMS code].
* **Changes in invasive vegetation cover**: User can adjust the initial vegetation cover. To modify the initial vegetation cover :
  * In the Excel file from the [SystemModel] folder modify the parameters _Init_CV_. Then run the GAMS code.
* **Changes in budget to reduce invasive vegetation**: User can adjust the financial budget (parameter budget) to represent an increase and decrease in the budget to remove invasive vegetation.To modify the budget:
  * In the Excel file from the [SystemModel] folder, modify the parameter _budget_. Then run the GAMS code.
* **Changes in water availability**: Model allows user to identified the impact of extreme hydrological events on wetland performance. To modify the inflow :
  * In the Excel file from the [SystemModel] folder, input the discharge data in the _Inflow_ sheet. Then run the GAMS code.
* **Simulation**: Wetland managers can also use the simulation capabilities to allocate pre-determined volumes of water to particular wetland units to achieve goals such as provide specific water depths in wetland units to provide recreation (hunting) services or control avian diseases like botulism. To modify the invasive vegetation response:
  * Open the GAMS model from the [SystemModel] folder and activate the Equation _S.fx(yr,mn,dy,wu)= DemandHy(yr,mn,dy,wu)_ in lines 697 on the [GAMS code]. Then run the GAMS code.

## Model Application at the Refuge:
We applied the model at the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge, which is the largest wetland complex on the Great Salt Lake, Utah. The Refuge includes 25 managed wetland units separated by dikes and supplied water through a series of canals controlled by gates and weirs. This hydraulic infrastructure allows managers to manipulate water levels in each wetland unit with the main purpose to provide habitat for a wide variety of plants, insects, amphibians, and birds. The Refuge typically experiences hydrological and ecological changes over time (e.g., water scarcity, invasive vegetation). Thus, Refuge managers have a pressing need to better allocate scarce water and control invasive vegetation to promote diverse habitat types and support a variety of bird species.
SWAMPS can provide to wetland manager an alternative tool to measure wetland performance as well as understand how wetland performance is affected by flow variability or invasive vegetation cover.
